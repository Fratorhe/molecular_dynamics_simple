# molecular_dynamics_simple
VERY simple and inefficient molecular dynamics code. 

This code was written in an afternoon only to understand the most basic algorithms behind molecular dynamics. 
It was also a good way to learn more Python and this is the reason it is written in a certain way, representing the atoms as objects of the class Atom, etc.

This is not intended to perform actual computations, only for a nice visualization atoms moving around.
